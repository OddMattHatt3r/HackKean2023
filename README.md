# HackKean2023

This is a project created by rodrigo1514 and I at the HackKean event in 2023

This project is designed after a BB84 Protocol

Using quantum mechanics, the output is designed to show its process

Typically the cipher uses a rondom starting message, however we decided to takee a message

Then, through quantum randomization, it generates a key specific to the two users
