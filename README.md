# HackKean2023

This is a project created by Rodrigo and I at the HackKean event in 2023

This project is designed after a BB84 Protocol

Using quantum mechanics, the output is designed to show its process

It takes a message to base the key off of, and through quantum randomization

generates a key specific to both users
